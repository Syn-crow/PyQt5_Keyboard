# PyQt5_Keyboard
keyboard and a class derived from QLineEdit optimized for touchscreen, made initialy for a GNNS project I had at my school (ENSG 🇫🇷). 

Réalisation originale: 1er Aout 2018

A faire/ to-do:
  - make usable without any custom QLineEdit
  - make missing commands related to the non-character key
  - add more keyboard layout (currently qwerty and azerty)
  - make it look better, custom space between layouts and widget (from .xml file)
